This is a personal guide to study for the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Examination.
This guide will include a breakdown of each chapter covered in OCA, tips and notes, and some explanation for example questions.  
The OCA book by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff is / will be referenced mostly.
You may clone it as you wish if found useful.

Best of luck to me and all the tester / developers to-be.
